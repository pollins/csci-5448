Adam Pollins

## Instructions
Project is contained in the "proj" package, main method is contained in Zoo.java.

## Assumptions
It is assumed that all felines will have an equal probability of doing anything, i.e., will not listen to the Zookeeper's commands.

Also, it's assumed that a "zoo of animals" implies that Zoo is itself supposed to be a collection.

## Design choices
The Zookeeper is a separate class whose methods take the Zoo object.
