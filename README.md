Adam Pollins

## Instructions
Project is contained in the "proj" package, main method is contained in Zoo.java. Run with `java -jar Zoo.jar`

## Assumptions
It is assumed that all felines will have an equal probability of sleeping, roaming, or making noise, i.e., will not listen to the Zookeeper's commands.

Also, it's assumed that a "zoo of animals" implies that Zoo is itself supposed to be a collection.

## Design choices
The Zookeeper is a separate class whose methods take the Zoo object.
